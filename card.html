			<p class="description">Whilst they will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet. Unlike most other bears, pandas do not hibernate. Female pandas give birth to one or two cubs every two years.</p>
			<p class="description">Sadly, these beautiful bears are endangered, and it’s estimated that <em>only around 1,000 remain</em> in the wild. That’s why we need to do all we can to protect them!</p>
